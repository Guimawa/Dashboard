The trajectory chronicles the development of a React MVP dashboard application, evolving through several stages. Initially, the AI engineer interpreted a request for a light dashboard, building a functional prototype with PWA capabilities and basic UI elements. Following user feedback, the focus shifted to achieving a pixel-perfect replication of a Handshake Influence Dashboard design, which involved substantial UI adjustments, including a denser network graph and a detailed layout. Critically, a bug emerged where realistic placeholder data was used instead of the explicit requirement for entirely empty, generic placeholders. The AI engineer promptly addressed this, undertaking a comprehensive cleanup, creating dedicated files for placeholder data () and design tokens (), establishing a new git branch (), and providing detailed, verifiable proofs of the corrections (git logs, diffs, grep tests, and screenshots) for user validation. The interaction concludes with the AI engineer presenting these final proofs.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a minimalist digital project management dashboard MVP, inspired by the Handshake Influence design, built as a light React app to optimize credit usage.
**Key UI/UX requirements**: Dark blue/black gradient background, empty network graph with placeholder bubbles (initially one, evolving to 50+ dense nodes) and a Cr√©e un nouveau projet prompt, empty right-panel ranking, top bar with filters (Statut/Date/Outil) and an empty notification bubble. It should feature a responsive hamburger menu for a sliding left sidebar with empty tabs (New Projet, Table Ronde IA, Outils, Vue d'ensemble, Suivi performances), and a hidden sliding taskbar.
**Technical requirements**: React with , , , . PWA-ready with basic service worker and . No real or fictive data initially, everything as empty placeholders.
**Critical Correction (Bug Fix)**: All real data (names, percentages, organizations, technologies) must be replaced by neutral, generic placeholders (e.g., Personne 1, XX.XX%, Organisation A, Titre placeholder).
**Deliverables for Correction**: Figma file/exports, PNG@2x and SVG of 3 artboards, , , modified files list + git diff/patch, live preview URL, commit SHA/branch.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Frontend Technologies**: React.js, Tailwind CSS (for styling), Framer Motion (animations),  and  (network graph).
-   **PWA**: Service Worker,  for offline capabilities and installability.
-   **State Management**: React Hooks (useState).
-   **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing branches.

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack project with a React frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. The development focused exclusively on the frontend.



-   : Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Added , , . Descriptions were later anonymized.
-   : Tailwind CSS configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Configured custom dark background color and a specific gradient ().
-   : Main HTML file for the React app.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with PWA meta tags and manifest link, crucial for PWA functionality.
-   : PWA manifest file.
    -   **Changes**: Created for PWA features (standalone display, theme colors). Later, all metadata was replaced with generic placeholder content.
-   : Service worker script.
    -   **Changes**: Created to provide basic offline caching and PWA readiness.
-   : React app entry point.
    -   **Changes**: Incorporated service worker registration logic to enable PWA features.
-   : Main React component responsible for routing.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include a  route, which initially rendered , and later switched to . Also updated generic texts.
-   : Initial placeholder dashboard component.
    -   **Changes**: Created as the first basic MVP dashboard implementation.
-   : The central component for the dashboard's complex UI.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent multiple significant updates. Initially created to replicate the pixel-perfect 3-column Handshake layout, including header, a graph, and a right panel. It was then modified to increase network graph density (to 58 nodes) and to implement a more realistic ranking. Crucially, in the final correction, it was extensively refactored to remove all hardcoded real data (names, percentages, specific technologies) and to use only generic placeholders, empty strings, and values from .
-   , : shadcn/ui components.
    -   **Changes**: Created to be used as foundational UI elements within the dashboard for consistency.
-   : New file containing an empty, structured JSON schema for dashboard data.
    -   **Content (Head)**:
        
    -   **Importance**: Ensures all dynamic data points in the UI are driven by a predefined empty structure, enforcing the placeholder-only requirement.
-   : New file for centralized CSS variables (design tokens).
    -   **Content (Head)**:
        
    -   **Importance**: Standardizes and centralizes styling parameters, improving maintainability and consistency of the design.
-   : Utility functions for PWA.
    -   **Changes**: Created to handle simulated data exports, secure storage, and notifications.
-   : Project deployment instructions and upgrade roadmap.
    -   **Changes**: Created with deployment steps, later updated with anonymized examples.
-   : Documentation detailing the bug fix.
    -   **Changes**: Created to document the specific modifications made to remove real data and implement placeholders.

<pending_tasks>
-   Provide Figma exports (.fig file, PNG@2x, and SVG for 3 artboards: Global, Focus+Panel, Header), which the AI engineer explicitly stated cannot be generated automatically.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a critical bug fix, removing all realistic data from the dashboard and replacing it with generic placeholders, as explicitly requested by the user. This involved extensive modifications to  and the creation of two new files:  (for an empty data schema) and  (for centralized CSS variables). The frontend was restarted, and a live preview URL () was provided, showing a completely virgin interface with no real names, percentages, or specific technologies visible.

The current activity involves providing the user with comprehensive, verifiable proofs of these corrections. This includes:
-   The last commit SHA () on the  branch.
-   Git diffs to show the modified files (specifically  additions, and changes to the core  and other relevant files in the full patch).
-   The head (first 200 lines) of the newly created  and  files.
-   Results from  commands, confirming the absence of specified real names and real percentages in the  directory.
-   Three screenshots of the live preview (Global, Focus+Panel, Header views) to visually confirm the placeholder-only UI.
The trajectory ends with the AI engineer in the process of providing the raw text outputs for these verification commands.
